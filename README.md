This is the final project of Inter Bank Android Bootcamp.

There are small differences between the original and my project. Since I have a small knowledge about software development for mobile, Kotlin was a new area to me, so don`t expect to find major changes of the final project.

This bootcamp opened my eyes for what is kotlin and what I should study more to develop nice apps. All the concept is understandable, but put the code in practice ... dear God.

By the way, if someone is reading this, I didn`t give up to study kotlin, it is just the begginig of a mobile journey!
